# [the system design interview (intermediate - advanced)](https://youtu.be/SNyDKw4DFPQ)

Today we talk about how to approach a system design interview (and hopefully how to do well in one!).  I talk about the general structure that they'll go and approaches you'll want to take.

## Interactive examples

### Notes

```text
1. relational database (mysql, postgres)
    - replication strategies
    - primary promotion
2. key-value / document database (mongodb, dynamo)
    - consistent hashing
    - how one scales up and down
3. caching store (memcached, redis)
    - eviction policies
4. pubsub / queueing (kafka, sns, sqs)
5. load balancer (alb, nginx / etc.)
6. high write columnar store (cassandra, clickhouse)
7. service discovery system (synapse-haproxy, envoy)
8. "consistency system" (zookeeper)
```
